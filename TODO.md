## Implementation Notes

### Current Status (Based on README)
- âœ… Basic syntax design (Entry functions, Print, Return)
- âœ… Comment syntax (// and /* */)
- âœ… String literals with single quotes
- âœ… Duck typing concept
- âœ… Uppercase keyword convention

### MVP Accomplished (August 2025)
- âœ… **Working lexer** - Tokenizes all basic language constructs
- âœ… **Functional parser** - Builds AST for hello world program
- âœ… **Code generator** - Outputs x86-64 assembly
- âœ… **Complete compiler** - Produces working ELF executables
- âœ… **Hello World** - Successfully compiles and runs example program
- âœ… **System integration** - Uses system assembler and linker
- âœ… **Project structure** - Organized Go modules and packages

### Key Design Decisions to Make
- [ ] Memory management strategy (GC vs manual)
- [ ] Compilation target (native, VM, transpilation)
- [ ] Standard library scope and design
- [ ] Error handling mechanisms
- [ ] Concurrency model
- [ ] Package/module system design

### Development Environment Setup
- [x] Set up Go development environment
- [x] Create project structure
- [ ] Set up testing framework
- [ ] Configure CI/CD pipeline
- [ ] Set up documentation system

## Getting Started
1. âœ… Begin with Phase 1.1 (Lexical Analysis)
2. âœ… Create a simple tokenizer that can handle the hello world example
3. ðŸ”„ Gradually expand to handle more language constructs
4. ðŸ”„ Test each component thoroughly before moving to the next phase

## Next Priority Items
Based on the MVP completion, the immediate next steps should be:

1. **Phase 1.3 - Semantic Analysis** (Foundation)
   - Symbol table implementation
   - Basic type checking
   - Scope management

2. **Phase 6.1 - Control Flow** (Language Expansion)
   - If/else statements
   - Loop constructs (for, while)

3. **Phase 2.2 - Type System** (Robustness)
   - Type inference
   - Type conversion rules

4. **Error Handling & Testing** (Quality)
   - Syntax error reporting with line numbers
   - Unit tests for compiler components
